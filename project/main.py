"""
PydanticAI demonstration of the AI Access Control Four Perimeters Framework

This implementation demonstrates the four access control perimeters framework with a practical example of a financial advisor agent:
1. Prompt Filtering: Ensures queries comply with financial advice regulations
2. Data Protection: Controls access to different levels of financial documentation
3. Secure External Access: Manages access to financial analysis capabilities
4. Response Enforcement: Enforces compliance requirements in responses

This demo uses Permit.io for fine-grained access control and PydanticAI for secure AI interactions.
